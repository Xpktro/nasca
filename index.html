  <h1>Nasca MIDI Bridge</h1>

    <div class="column">
      <h3>What</h3>
      <p>This is a MIDI processor that will allow you to use the 13-note Nasca culture scale on any pitchbend-capable MIDI instrument.</p>
      <p>Just connect a MIDI interface to your computer, select the appropiate input/output ports and play. Every note sent through the input device will be replaced by another corresponding Nasca scale degree based on the current fundamental tone and sent back through the output device.</p>
      <p>The scale's fundamental note can be set by pressing the "Set Fundamental Note" button and pressing the desired note key in your MIDI controller.</p>
      <p><i>Note:</i> Set your instrument's pitchbend range to 2 semitones for this to work properly.</p>

      <h3>How</h3>
      <p>
        In 2017, peruvian musicologist Américo Valencia Chacón published a book titled "Música Nasca - Fundamentos, Permanencia y Cambio" (roughly translated
        as "Nasca Music - Foundations, Continuity and Changes") after an investigation in which he discovers that Nascas (100 B.C. - 800 A.C.) -besides their
        impressive advancements in architecture, textile production and others- had a complete tuning system based on mathematically verifiable, simple physical principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results from this investigation determined the existence of a musical scale consisting of 13 notes used for Nasca pan flutes tuning,
        whose distribution follows an hyperbolic curve based on a fundamental tone described by the dimensions of largest tube in their build.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the book summary says: "(...) These findings definitively sets aside Raoul and Marguerite D'Harcourt research (1925), who state
        andean music foundation is pentaphonic. Without a doubt, the book constitutes an important and groundbreaking contribution to andean
        pre-Hispanic musical knowledge"
